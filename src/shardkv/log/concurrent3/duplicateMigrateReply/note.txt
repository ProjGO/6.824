duplicate MigrateReply
    In a new config a shard is assigned to the server but the server doesn't have the data of this shard.
    So it can't serve for this shard and needs to send MigrateRequest to the server that is responsible for the shard in last config.
    The MigrateRequest is sent periodically by a daemon. The daemon will send every request in a seperate go routine.
    So every request is processed asyncronisely and will be sent mutiple times until one of them have a "OK" response.
    => There will be duplicated MigrateReply

    What if we don't deal with this?
    shard is "to be pulled" -> MigrateReply is received -> shard is "ok to server" -> new Append request comes, and commited by raft, executed by kv, responsed to client
    -> duplicated MigrateReply comes -> the superseded shard data in MigrateReply overwrites the newer shard data
    -> the commited Append Op between MigrateReply is lost

    Solution
        Apply a MigrateReply only when the corresponding shard status is "to be pulled"
        And set the shard status to "ok to server" once after the MigrateReply is applied.
