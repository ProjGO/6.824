kvraft:
    TestSnapshotRecoverManyClients3B
        fail (losing append operation) with low probability (< 1%)
        decreasing snapshot size threshold seems to increase the fail probability
        "snapshot size threshold":
            the lab document requires that raft.StateSize() < 8 * kv.maxraftstate
            Firstly implemented incorrectly as "kv.rf.StateSize() > kv.maxraftstate"
                => high fail prob (16 / 1000)
            fixed to "> 7 * kv.maxraftstate" (8 * kv.maxraftstate will cause StateSize() > 8 * kv.maxraftstate sometimes then fails the test)
                => lower fail prob (5 / 1000)
        I'm not sure the real cause of this problem or how to fix it thoroughly
    TestPersistPartitionUnreliable3A
        similar problem, losing append, (P < 1 / 1000)
